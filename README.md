# HackathonML

We made this project as a part of the Hackathon in the Annual TechFest of IIT Ropar - Advitiya. Our problem statement was to tackle cyber security issues using AI/ML. We made 5 sub-projects.

#DeepFake Detector
This model recognized deepfakes from real images by an accuracy of 94%. This can be embedded in social media websites to filter out degrading content

#Troll Police
This used the youtube comments of a channel to identify top 10 trolls of a youtube channel. This can be extended to reduce negative content from all social media.

#BotDefender
This used the anomaly detection algorithm and historical Gaussian distribution to detect bot activity on a website. This can not only increase the security of a website but also can be used to anticipate server demands to prevent server crashes

#Malware Detector
This identified the malware on the basis of the metadata of a file. This can be embedded in current systems to block malicious softwares.

#PhishingLinkGuard
This determined the probability of a link being a phishing link just on the basis of the url. This can be embedded in the web system to block malicious websites.
